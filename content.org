** My notes
:PROPERTIES:

Just before starting my PhD I came across the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten][Zettelkasten]] method as well as the book /How to take Smart Notes/ by Sonke Ahrens autocite:ahrensHowTakeSmart2017. Zettelkasten is a method of non-hierarchical note taking where notes contain information about a single topic and are linked together to make manual connections. I've implemented my notes repository in [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] [[https://orgmode.org/][org mode]] and the [[https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam][org-roam]] package.

While I've not made my notes public, I have done some data analysis and tracking of them the code which I have made public.
- [[https://github.com/TimQuelch/notes-snapshot][notes-snapshot]]: contains the scripts and ~systemd~ unit files that I use to regularly take snapshots of my notes
- [[https://github.com/TimQuelch/notes-timeline][notes-timeline]]: contains my data analysis written in ~Julia~

** OrgMode.jl

Many of my [[id:99331808-d401-476d-a41a-6f168e7bbd2f][notes]] and task management is written in [[https://orgmode.org][org mode]]. As part of my data analysis of my notes, I need to parse the ~.org~ files to differentiate the content within the files. I created [[https://github.com/TimQuelch/OrgMode.jl][OrgMode.jl]] in Julia so I had a nice native interface for my data analysis.
